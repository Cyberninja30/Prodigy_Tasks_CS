Encrypting text involves transforming plaintext into ciphertext using an algorithm and key, ensuring confidentiality and privacy by making the message unreadable to unauthorized parties. Conversely,decryption 
reverses this process, converting ciphertext back into plaintext with the same algorithm and key, allowing authorized recipients to access the original message. These processes are fundamental in cryptography, 
safeguarding sensitive information during transmission or storage and maintaining the integrity of secure communication.

The Caesar Cipher algorithm, named after Julius Caesar who reportedly used it for secret communication, is one of the simplest and earliest known encryption techniques. It involves shifting each letter in 
the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. 

This is how the provided code performs encryption and decryption on a given text as mentioned below:

1. Encryption (`caesar_encrypt` function):
   - The function takes two parameters: the plaintext message (`text`) and the shift value (`shift`).
   - It iterates through each character in the plaintext message.
   - For each alphabetic character (`char.isalpha()`), it calculates the new position of the character after shifting by the specified amount (`shift`).
   - The new position is calculated using modular arithmetic to ensure that the shifted position wraps around within the range of alphabetic characters (from 'a' to 'z' or 'A' to 'Z').
   - The function then determines the case of the character (uppercase or lowercase) and calculates the corresponding encrypted character using the shifted position.
   - Non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged.
   - Finally, the encrypted character is appended to the `encrypted_text` string.
   - The function returns the resulting `encrypted_text` string containing the encrypted message.

2. Decryption (`caesar_decrypt` function):
   - Similar to encryption, the decryption function takes the ciphertext message (`text`) and the shift value (`shift`) as parameters.
   - It iterates through each character in the ciphertext message.
   - For each alphabetic character, it calculates the new position of the character after shifting in the opposite direction by the specified amount (`shift`).
   - The new position is calculated using modular arithmetic, similar to encryption.
   - The function determines the case of the character and calculates the corresponding decrypted character using the shifted position.
   - Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.
   - The decrypted character is appended to the `decrypted_text` string.
   - The function returns the resulting `decrypted_text` string containing the decrypted message.

3. Main Function (`main()`):
   - The main function serves as an interface for the user to choose between encryption and decryption.
   - It takes user input for the operation (encrypt or decrypt), the message, and the shift value.
   - Based on the user's choice, it calls either the `caesar_encrypt` or `caesar_decrypt` function with the provided inputs.
   - It then displays the resulting encrypted or decrypted message to the user.
