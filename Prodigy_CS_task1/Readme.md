Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

The Caesar Cipher algorithm, named after Julius Caesar who reportedly used it for secret communication, is one of the simplest and earliest known encryption techniques. It involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

How it works?

Encryption (caesar_encrypt function):

1. The function takes two parameters: the plaintext message (text) and the shift value (shift).
2. It iterates through each character in the plaintext message.
3. For each alphabetic character (char.isalpha()), it calculates the new position of the character after shifting by the specified amount (shift).
4. The new position is calculated using modular arithmetic to ensure that the shifted position wraps around within the range of alphabetic characters (from 'a' to 'z' or 'A' to 'Z').
5. The function then determines the case of the character (uppercase or lowercase) and calculates the corresponding encrypted character using the shifted position.
6. Non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged.
7. Finally, the encrypted character is appended to the encrypted_text string.
8. The function returns the resulting encrypted_text string containing the encrypted message.

Decryption (caesar_decrypt function):

Similar to encryption, the decryption function takes the ciphertext message (text) and the shift value (shift) as parameters.
It iterates through each character in the ciphertext message.
For each alphabetic character, it calculates the new position of the character after shifting in the opposite direction by the specified amount (shift).
The new position is calculated using modular arithmetic, similar to encryption.
The function determines the case of the character and calculates the corresponding decrypted character using the shifted position.
Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.
The decrypted character is appended to the decrypted_text string.
The function returns the resulting decrypted_text string containing the decrypted message.
Usage
Run the Script: Execute the Python script containing the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption functions.

Choose Operation: The main function serves as an interface for the user to choose between encryption and decryption.

Input Parameters: Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt, along with the shift value.

Get Result: Based on the user's choice, the script will perform either encryption or decryption and display the resulting message.

Benefits

Simple and Effective: The Caesar Cipher algorithm provides a straightforward method for encrypting and decrypting messages.

Fast Execution: The Python implementation ensures efficient processing of encryption and decryption operations.

Educational Purpose: Helps users understand the basics of encryption and decryption techniques.

Note:-

Security Limitations: The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption algorithm and may not provide sufficient security for sensitive information. It is vulnerable to brute-force attacks and frequency analysis.
