The Keylogger is a Python script designed to capture and log keystrokes from a keyboard. This tool can be used for various purposes, including monitoring computer usage, debugging, or forensic analysis. 
Please note that the usage of keyloggers may be subject to legal restrictions depending on the jurisdiction, and it's essential to use them responsibly and ethically.

How It Works
The script utilizes the pyxhook library to create a keyboard hook that captures keystrokes. When a key is pressed, the script records the corresponding ASCII character and writes it to a log file along with the timestamp of the event. The log file is named based on the current date and time, making it easy to organize and analyze the captured data.

Usage:-

1.Run the Script: Execute the Python script keylogger.py.

2.Capture Keystrokes: The script will start capturing keystrokes in real-time as you type.

3.Log File: The captured keystrokes are saved to a log file in the current directory. Each log file is named with the format DD-MM-YYYY|HH:MM.log, indicating the date and time when the logging started.

4.Stop Logging: To stop the logging process, press Ctrl + C in the terminal where the script is running.

Privacy: Be mindful of privacy concerns when using keyloggers. Ensure that you have appropriate consent or authorization before monitoring keyboard activity on a device.
